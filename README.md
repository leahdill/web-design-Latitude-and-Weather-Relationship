# web-design-challenge

In this challenge, we were tasked with presenting data and conclusions from a past project that explored the relationship between latitude and various weather metrics in the form of a modestly interactive website. From the landing page, you may navigate to any one of the concluding graphs and also access the working dataset we were provided to analyze.
